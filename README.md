# Face Mask Detection

Welcome to the **Face Mask Detection** project by [apernesh-23](https://github.com/apernesh-23).

## Overview

This project is designed to automatically detect whether individuals are wearing face masks using computer vision and deep learning techniques. Built with Python, it leverages modern machine learning methods to provide accurate and real-time mask detection, making it useful for public safety, workplace compliance, and health monitoring applications.

## Features

- **Automatic Face Mask Detection:** Identifies faces in images or video streams and determines if a mask is present.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Suitable for live monitoring via webcams or CCTV feeds.
- **Scalable and Extendable:** Can be adapted for different environments and detection requirements.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language for development.
- Machine Learning and Computer Vision libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV).
- Pre-trained models for face detection and mask classification.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/apernesh-23/FaceMaskDetection.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies (see `requirements.txt` if available):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the detection script or notebook as provided.
